The Chicago Building Energy Use Benchmarking Ordinance calls on existing municipal, commercial, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to track whole-building energy use, report to the City annually, and verify data accuracy every three years. The law, which was phased in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicagoâ€™s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking The ordinance authorizes the City to share property-specific information with the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is required to comply. The dataset represents self-reported and publicly-available property information by calendar year. Currently, the data includes calendar year 2014 information for 243 properties, calendar year 2015 information for over 1,500 properties, calendar year 2016 information for over 2,700 properties, and calendar year 2017 information for almost 2,800 properties. The "Data Year" column and filtered views under "More Views" can be used to isolate specific years.
